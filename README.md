Sign language translation software for CSE 442

The team - 
Chris Serafini, Tim McCormick, Manikandan Sundararajan, Aditya Bhavnani, Tim McClusky

The purpose - 
The purpose of this project is to develop software that can accurately translate sign language into English. The applications of such a system are endless. There are 70 million people worldwide who use sign langauge primarily for communication. It would enable such people to communicate effectively with those that don't.

The tech - 
We will be using the Leap motion to create this software. The leap motion allows us to track hand movement with a high degree of accuracy. The majority of the work that needs to be done is to implement a method that can recognize sign language gestures. We will also be using some facial recognition to gather contextual clues which will make translation easier.
