The **master** branch contains deployment ready code.\r\nPlease check the requirements given below and update your system accordingly.\r\n\r\n  1. Download the Leap Motion Controller software package from the Leap Motion website. Direct Linux Download Link: (https://warehouse.leapmotion.com/apps/4186/download) Website Link: (https://www.leapmotion.com/setup/linux)\r\n  2. Extract the Leap Motion Controller software package to a preferred location.\r\n  3. Install the Leap Motion Controller software. This can be done by either right clicking on the software file and installing it, or by running: sh $ sudo dpkg --install (extracted Leap Motion Controller software file)\r\n  4. Navigate to the Release folder and double click on the file titled \"AppRun\" to open the application\r\n  \r\n### Using The Visualizer\r\nWhen you run the project, you will see our user interface. Click the **red** button to open/close the Leap Motion Diagnostic Visualizer. This Visualizer will let you see what the Leap motion sees when your hand is in view. You can use this to adjust your hand position/orientation for maximum sign recognition.\r\n\r\n### General Use of the Gesture Translator\r\nThe application consists of 3 parts. The box at the top right shows what letter the application thinks you are signing. The box at the bottom left shows what letter you should be signing and the box at the top left is a reference image for the current letter. You can use the Visualizer in conjunction with the reference image to perfect your ASL!\r\n",
