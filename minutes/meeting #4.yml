issues: [
  {ubit: mtiruman, issue: Entire group is unfamiliar with machine learning process, but believe that it would be a good fit for the project. Mani in particular said he would look into developing a system, but it seems like a large enough issue for more people.},
  {ubit: tsmccorm, issue: Group believes that having a sample of the Leap Motion's output would help for formatting, Tim agreed to do this.}
  {ubit: chserafi, issue: Group agreed that having the Leap Motion mounted in a webcam-like orientation would be beneficial. Chris will look into finding a mount.}

Notes:  |
  Group should implement GitHub issues, as they are part of further points.
  Group decided to separate natural counting and the alphabet based on which hand was in vision. Left hand will handle normal counting, right hand will handle signed alphabet.
