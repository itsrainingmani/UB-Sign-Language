Notes:  |
  Group discussed worries about the latent accuracy of the Leap Motion. Determined that it could be possibly to modify the source code.
  Overall goal of the project changed to implement static letters, possibly J and Z, and turn the program into a program that can help users learn fingerspelling.
  Group discussed plans about how to merge code bases after Sprint #2 is complete, giving us time to finish our individual letters.
  Talked with Jessie about the possibility of checking out a Leap Motion so that we could develop from home.
