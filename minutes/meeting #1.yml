issues: [
  {ubit: chserafi, issue: The Leap Motion does not seem to have the capability to recognize full body motions / facial features. This could make full body signing and expressions difficult to implement.}
  ]
Notes:  |
  No roles have been given to any particular member at this point, hence why no "progress" is labeled for anyone.
  Determined that using the "Leap Motion" would be the best choice in terms of hardware.
  Due to the use of the Leap Motion, it was determined that coding in C++ on a Linux environment would be optimal.
  Machine learning of gestures was discussed, though members felt that it would be too ambitous. Kept as a stretch goal.
  Stretch goal #1 - After initial funcitons were developed on the Leap Motion, convert the functionality so that only a webcam would be necessary.
  Stretch goal #2 - Create a lexer / analyzer for the generated English such that it can be converted from raw translation into vernacular English. 
  Stretch goal #3 - Use similar gesture recognition technology to control a desktop coputer / specific video game of our choosing.
  Stretch goal #4 - Support for multiple languages, i.e. convert American Sign Language into Spanish / convert International Sign Language into French.
  Stretch goal #5 - Create a mini-game that would teach unfamiliar users how to sign basic information.
  Stretch goal #6 - Converting this software for use with mobile devices.
